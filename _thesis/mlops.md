While we have made tremendous progress in terms of performance of machine learning models,
embedding ML models in complex real world systems still poses a lot of unique challenges,
that often prevent models from going beyond the prototype stage.
The relatively new field of MLOps aims at developing practices and processes to make
deploying machine learning models as easy as deploying traditional software.

Possible topics include

* developing process models and tools for the machine learning life cycle
* investigating ways of testing and monitoring machine learning models
