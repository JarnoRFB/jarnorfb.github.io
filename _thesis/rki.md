The [Signale Team](https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/infections/epidemiology/signals/projects/signals_project_node.html;jsessionid=E64E7ADECF56F1D473BDF25CF69DC8D3.2_cid363) at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin applies a broad range of data science
and machine learning techniques to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
As the major public health institution in Germany, the Robert Koch Institute has access to
a lot of interesting data.

I wrote my Masterthesis in the Signale Team and can highly recommend going there.
As sharing sensitive medical data is difficult, you have to go to Berlin to write
your thesis, while I can provide remote supervision. This is a great opportunity
to see the capital and see a new working environment, plus you will even be offered a student job. 
While master theses are preferred,
a bachelor thesis in combination with an internship might also be possible.

Possible topics include

* detection of disease outbreaks using statistical and machine learning methods
* using machine learning to improve the workflows of epidemiologists
* creating dashboards and visualizations to improve the understanding of disease spread

More detailed proposals can be found at [https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/IfSG/Signale/Stellenangebote/Mastertheses.pdf?__blob=publicationFile](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/IfSG/Signale/Stellenangebote/Mastertheses.pdf?__blob=publicationFile), but your own ideas
are welcome.
