Half of my time I work at the local start up [AIM](https://www.agile-im.de) / [Inserve](https://inserve.de)
on real world machine learning projects. Our office is at the ICO, very close to the Westerberg Campus.

If you are interested in applied machine learning, you are sure to find a topic that interests you.
Our application domains include

* computer vision
* predictive logistics
* natural language processing
* optical character recognition
* speech recognition
* MLOps
* ...

If you are passionate about programming, doing your thesis in a company will be a great learning experience.
However, you should be available for at least six month, regardless of whether you want to do a bachelor or master thesis.
In addition to filling out the contact form, please also send a short CV and your current transcript to rbusche@uos.de.
