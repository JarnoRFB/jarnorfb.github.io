Ever read an exciting paper that you could not find any source code for?
It has long been recognized by the scientific community that transparency
and reproducibility of computational experiments are very important.
Journals like [ReScience](http://rescience.github.io/) encourage the
replication of existing results and publishes them together with open
source code. 
So why not implement the paper yourself and contribute your results back to the community?
This is the perfect scope for a bachelor thesis, but can also be part of a larger
master thesis.

Similarly, you might have always wanted to write an open source package for a scientific
problem you had to solve over and over again, because no good open source solution
exists. Your thesis might be the perfect opportunity to bridge this gap. Again journals
like [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org) provide a great venue to share your results with the community.
