DeepRain is my main PhD project in which we try to improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of rain forecasts using deep learning.
The BMBF funded project is a collaboration among the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) at Forschungszentrum Jülich, the German Weather Service (DWD), the Universities of Osnabrück and Bonn and the Jacobs University in Bremen.
For more information on the project see also [https://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc/EN/Research/Projects/DeepRain/_node.html](https://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc/EN/Research/Projects/DeepRain/_node.html).

Your work could involve

* experimenting with neural network architectures
* find interesting ways to visualize and validate model predictions
* improve the workflow of doing deep learning on geo data in a supercomputing environment

To cope with the massive amounts of data, you will get access to the Jülich supercomputing environment.
A fact that renders this project a very interesting learning experience, for those interested
in big data and high performance computing.
